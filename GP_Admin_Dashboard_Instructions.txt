INSTRUCTIONS for creating the function and stored procedures
for the GP Admin Dashboard refex.

1. Rename Build_GP_Admin_Dashboard_Procs.TXT with an SQL extension
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and log into your
    Dynamics GP SQL Server
3. Open the freshly renamed Build_GP_Admin_Dashboard_Procs.SQL script
4. Change the [YourSystemDB] on the first line to the name of your
    GP System database (usually DYNAMICS)
5. Execute the script
6. That's all you need to do in SSMS

Now you just need to open the GPDashboard.xlsm in Excel and
follow the 6 steps to enable the refex to read your GP SQL
databases. 

(Your Excel security needs to allow macro execution)

If you have more than one GP SQL Server, then simply make a
copy of the original GPDashboard.xlsm, rename it, open it,
and go through the 6 steps. You will, of course, need to run
the SQL script on your other GP SQL Servers.
