SQL Scripts for Dashboard on a Dime Session / Webinar
Part 2. GP Analytics

Instructions to use the scripts.

Due to technical limitations, the SQL scripts had to be renamed with .txt extensions to 
be uploaded to GPUG. Don't forget to rename them back to .sql or open them in Notepad and 
copy / paste the code to SSMS.

TEST this out before you put this into a Prduction environment.
Please run the SQL scripts against your GP system database (usually DYNAMICS)
Run the scripts in the order of the sequence file numbering
Make sure your SQL Mail configuration is setup & working properly to send out notification
Don't forget to tweak the threashold numbers for Script 2 & 3 before running them in SQL


Within the Excel workbook, edit the data Connections for the queries to point to your current 
DYNAMICS instance (by default the SQL server is labled DYNAMICSGP\DYNAMICSGP)
